# React Native Sample App ðŸ“±âœ¨

This is a **React Native sample application** built with [Expo](https://expo.dev) and featuring **NativeWind integration** for seamless TailwindCSS styling in React Native.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- **React Native** with Expo Router for file-based navigation
- **NativeWind** integration for using TailwindCSS utility classes in React Native
- **PNPM** for fast, efficient package management
- **Cross-platform** support (iOS, Android, Web)
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Modern UI** with utility-first CSS styling

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   pnpm start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
pnpm reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## ðŸŽ¨ Styling with NativeWind & TailwindCSS

This project demonstrates how to use **NativeWind** to bring TailwindCSS to React Native development:

- **Utility-first styling**: Use familiar Tailwind classes like `bg-blue-500`, `text-center`, `flex-1`
- **Responsive design**: Built-in support for responsive breakpoints
- **Dark mode**: Easy theme switching with Tailwind's dark mode utilities
- **Custom configuration**: Tailwind config is set up in `tailwind.config.js`

### Example Usage

```tsx
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

export default function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <View className="flex-1 justify-center items-center bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-900">
      <Text className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 dark:text-white">
        Hello NativeWind!
      </Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```
